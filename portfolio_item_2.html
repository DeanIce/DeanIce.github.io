            <p>One of my earliest game design projects was to entire recreate the first level in Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. using C# and monogame. In the spring of 2021 I learned how to use monogame, create sprites,
            design a collision handler from scratch, and much more to recreate that famous level. We were placed in teams and tasked to expand on the game in some meaningful way, most groups decided to simply create the
            next level. My team and I however, decided to go outside of the box and recreate another classic, Kirby's Adventure
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>We desinged a lengthy PBI document detailing the features we planned on adding, and tracked our progress in Azure DevOps. I gained skills working in a tight deadline, leading team meetings, and most importantly learning
            when to call a project finished. While there is still a lot that could be done with our version of Kirby, we accomplished all the goals initially set and I'm proud of the final result. It was this project that solidified my love
            for game design and programming alongside my fellow developers. Below you can find the link to first level of my version of Kirby's Adventure!
